<h1>About Me</h1>

  I am an experienced IT professional seeking a career change back to a role
  more focused on software development, after many years of being a database

  While my most previous experience has been in Loyalty Rewards as a Senior
  Database Administrator, I originally started out as an application developer
  and I’m confident that the experience and skills gained throughout my career
  have prepared me for this position. In reviewing my resume, you’ll find that
  in my time with Inte Q (formerly SHC Direct) I have adapted to successfully
  perform a number of different roles as needed by the company. I started in
  application development on a Unix system, and over the years, led the company
  transition to Microsoft SQL Server, and the latest iteration to MS SQL Server
  hosted on AWS, with Snowflake for data warehousing. While I thrive on the
  problem solving that present in my current role, I miss the joy of programming
  and seeing the results come to fruition when done correctly. I am confident
  that my skills combined with my experience make me well qualified for this
  role and the continued success of American Express.
