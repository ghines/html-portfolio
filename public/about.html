<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an experienced IT professional seeking a career change back to software
  development after many years of being a database administrator. I am a
  committed and versatile lifelong learner who has a passion for learning new
  programming ideas and solving problems.
</p>
<p>
  In reviewing my resume, youâ€™ll find that in my time with Inte Q (formerly SHC
  Direct) I have adapted to successfully perform a number of different roles as
  needed by the company. I started in application development on a Unix system,
  and over the years, led the company transition to Microsoft SQL Server, and
  the latest iteration to MS SQL Server hosted on AWS, with Snowflake for data
  warehousing. I have been working fully remote for the past 4 years and was the
  pilot individual for the company's remote policy over 9 years ago (3 days at
  work, 2 at home).
</p>
<p>
  While I thrive on the problem solving that infuses my current role, I miss the
  joy of programming and seeing the results come to fruition when performed
  correctly. I am confident that my skills combined with my experience make me
  well-qualified for this role.
